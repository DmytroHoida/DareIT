My name is <b>Dmytro</b>. I've been working as a teacher at a primary school and currently, I am in the middle of changing my career path. I have tried to find work as a manual tester, but it was not as easy as I had expected.<br><br>
That is why I decided to take part in the <b>Dare IT Challenge</b>, because I believe that skills in test automation will help me find my first job.<br><br>
In addition, I hope that I will meet interesting people who I will have kept in touch with even after the course ends.
