# Task 1: Software Cofiguration 
## Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the Dare IT Challenge?
My name is Dmytro. I've been working as a teacher at a primary school
and currently, I am in the middle of changing my career path. I have tried 
to find work as a manual tester, but it was not as easy as I had expected.
That is why I decided to take part in the Dare IT Challenge, because
I believe that skills in test automation will help me find my first job.
